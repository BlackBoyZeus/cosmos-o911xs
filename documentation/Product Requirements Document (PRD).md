The flowchart illustrates the end-to-end process of the Cosmos World Foundation Model platform:

1. Input data enters the system and goes through the data curation pipeline
2. The curated data is tokenized using either continuous or discrete tokenization
3. Based on the model type, the data flows into either:
   - Diffusion-based WFM pipeline
   - Autoregressive-based WFM pipeline
4. Both model types go through pre-training and post-training stages
5. The trained models pass through pre-Guard and post-Guard safety systems
6. Finally, the guarded models generate the output

The flowchart maintains consistency with the key components described in the documentation including:
- Data curation steps (splitting, filtering, annotation, deduplication, sharding)
- Tokenization process (encoding, token generation, decoding) 
- Both diffusion and autoregressive model pipelines
- Pre-training and post-training stages
